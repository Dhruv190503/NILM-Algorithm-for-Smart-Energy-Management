# NILM-Algorithm-for-Smart-Energy-Management
This repository showcases my internship project at Ideabytes Software India, where I developed a Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) algorithm for a Smart Energy Management System. I analyzed real-time data from two geysers to predict energy utilization patterns, applying various AI and ML techniques to enhance energy efficiency.
